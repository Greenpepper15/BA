Added a function that traverses the netlist forwards and backwards to find nodes of a specific type and generates a warning in case the results of the traverses do not match.

#### Description
<!--- Describe your changes in detail -->
I checked the ODIN optimization, techmap, and cleanup routines and found no problems in the code that could cause the nodes to be incorrectly removed. I added a function to the check_netlist() routine which is called after the elaboration and before the optimization phase. Just like the remove_unused_logic() function, it traverses the netlist forwards and backwards and searches for a specific node type (currently multiply nodes). If the number of the nodes found in the traverses doesn't match, it will generate a warning to indicate discontinuity within the netlist. I'm planning to extend this feature to check the netlist for main nodes types e.g. logical, addition. The feature can notify a user when there is a discontinuity in an input design, which will result in the main nodes being removed in the cleanup stage of Odin.

Removing pins extension of the multipliers output ports, that were connected to PAD node, and extending the output port using new pins to avoid unconnected wires in the output BLIF (which is resulting in ABC segfault). 

NOTE: the new output pins are removed at the end of Odin-II execution since their nets do not have any fanouts. While PAD pins remained in the output netlist in the previous version

#### Description
<!--- Describe your changes in detail -->
Except for the VTR primitives, the rest of models in architecture files could not be parsed by Yosys elaborator in the Yosys+Odin synthesizer unless Yosys is provided with modules' signature. This was possible previously, by adding the modules signatures manually in a Verilog file and pass it to Yosys+Odin-II. This PR automate this process by:
- A VerilogWriter entity is added to go through the arch.xml and generate a Verilog file including the declaration of all models, except for VTR primitive hard blocks (i.e., single_port_ram, dual_port_ram, adder, and multiply)
- Yosys is provided with the signature of models defined in the arch file via the generated Verilog file ( `arch_dsp.v`) in the ODIN_II directory. Additionally, the `-blackbox` option is added to the write_blif command in the yosys script to print out the definition of the used hard blocks in the coarse-grained BLIF file, and the `-purge_lib` option is added to the hierarchy command to avoid printing the definition of unused ones.
- Odin-II BLIF Reader creates a `HARD_IP` nodes for blackboxes and passes them untouched to the subsequent phases.

Adding a few handy makefile options for the Yosys+Odin-II synthesizer.
complimentary changes to PR #1798 

Users can use all Odin-II makefile options for Yosys+Odin-II as long as the ``ELABORATOR=YOSYS`` is passed to the make call.
For example:
```
# assumed the following commands run in the ODIN_II root directory

# build Yosys+Odin-II
make build ELABORATOR=YOSYS

# build Yosys+Odin-II with Odin-II in debug mode
make debug ELABORATOR=YOSYS

# run techmap_heavysuite and techmap_lightsuite to verify the functionality of the Yosys+Odin-II synthesizer
make test ELABORATOR=YOSYS

# regenerate the expectation results of all Yosys+Odin-II regression tests
make regenerate_expectation ELABORATOR=YOSYS
```

**NOTE**: the value of the ``ELABORATOR`` could be ``ODIN`` or ``YOSYS``. By default, the value is considered as ``ODIN`` and the value is not case sensitive. If nothing is passed to the make call, it automatically considers ``ODIN`` as the elaborator.

This PR provides the VTR flow with scripts to run Yosys as the synthesizer.
The Yosys synthesis script is mostly inspired by what Eddie Hung proposed for [VTR-to-Bitstream](https://github.com/eddiehung/eddiehung.github.io/releases/tag/vtb_v2.1). However, some changes like removing the ABC stage from inside of the Yosys and adding new designs to perform depth splitting for single_port_ram and dual_port_ram are added, and updating the yosys_models with recent Yosys changes have been applied.

#### Description
<!--- Describe your changes in detail -->
This PR adds the functionality of using Odin's technology mapping for a Yosys generated BLIF file in coarse grain format. Basically, the feature is added according to the following flow:
1. **Yosys**: A hardware design will be given to Yosys. Using the commands mentioned in [synth.tcl](https://github.com/verilog-to-routing/vtr-verilog-to-routing/blob/d4fabdfd764a44379a9358cbb5edfd9cca5d9e7c/ODIN_II/regression_test/tools/synth.tcl) script, Yosys generates a coarsen (not exploded into low-level logic) BLIF file. Technically, the generated BLIF file should have Yosys logic cells. such as $and, $logic_and, $add, $sub, $div, $pow, $mul, $mem and etc.
2. **BLIF Reader**: Odin-II is fed by the generated BLIF file as the main design. At this point, other options like architecture files can also be given to Odin-II as before.
3. **BLIF Elaboration**: The BLIF file will pass to the BLIF Elaboration phase, which basically, makes the netlist compatible with Odin-II's partial mapping. Worth noting to mention that some Yosys logic cells such as simple DFF or bitwise operations will be passed to the partial mapping phase intact. The first critical stage of the Yosys+Odin happens in the BLIF Elaboration phase since some logic cells like $pow, $div or $mul will be exploded into smaller components such as adders or shifters. Moreover, the block memories are being detected at this point; however, the hard-block mapping or memory-related optimization process will happen in the mid-phase between BLIF Elaboration and Partial mapping. The third phase for other logic cells, like logical nodes, will only include input/output ports reordering to make them compatible with the partial mapping structure.

   3.1.  **Optimization**: This phase includes some optimization and decision-making concerning Odin-II's logic cells mapping and the given architecture. For instance, memory blocks generated by Yosys will be split into smaller pieces. Basically, a memory block generated by Yosys, excluding hard blocks such as SPRAM or DPRAM, is a whole memory cell that includes all reading and writing ports. As a result, not only this memory cell needs to be split into memory nodes compatible with Odin-II's partial mapping and available hard blocks, but also a few potential optimizations such as memory size or port size reductions are available at this point. Generally, Odin-II categorizes Yosys memory blocks in two: Read-Only Memory (ROM) and Block Memory (BRAM). ROMs will be mapped to SPRAM or DPRAM based on the number of reading ports. BRAMs, are mostly mapped to DPRAMs. Only if the read and the write address are equal, the BRAM will be mapped to SPRAM. Another potential optimization for memories here is to check the memory depth and see if it can fit into LUTRAMs. Some thresholds have been set based on the 6-LUTs specifications in Stratix IV and later; however, the LUTRAM inference in this tool is not one of those complicated ones. In addition to memories, adders will be modified at this stage if available adder hard blocks exist in the architecture file. Indeed, an adder node will be split into a chain of single-bit adders. Modifications like adding carry ports happen here as well.  
  
4. **Partial mapping**: The fourth phase slightly changed from what partial mapping was in Odin-II previously. In this phase, Odin-II would partially map the netlist to low-level logic. The second essential phase is happening here since the given circuit to Yosys would utilize the available hard blocks in the VTR flow. These hard blocks are comprising of the available hard blocks in the given architecture to the Odin-II. Worth noting here that the primitive modules specified in the vtr_flow directory are given to Yosys as a library. That means users can also use VTR primitive components such as `single_port_ram`, `dual_port_ram` and `adder` as before. (**Note**: the infrastructure for this feature is completely implemented in Yosys+Odin. However, there is an issue with Yosys in which it does not generate these hard blocks with the user-defined size in the design file. The issue is filed in the Yosys repository [link](https://github.com/YosysHQ/yosys/issues/2827). The temporary solution for this issue is to paste the definition of these modules in the given design from vtr_flow/primitive.v).

**Some notes worth mentioning**:
- New supported designs in Odin-II:
    * Constant multiplication using shift operation.
    * Division and Modulo (constant and variable)
    * Exponentiation
    * Yosys synthesizable logic cells
- In this PR, the structure of Input and Output for Odin-II has changed as follow:
    * A _GenericIO_ class, including _GenericReaders_ and _GenericWriters_ has been added.
    * Each _GenericReader_ has the `_read` method, which is implemented based on the language structure. Currently, Odin-II only supports Verilog and BLIF as the input languages. 
    * Similarly, each _GenericWriter_ has the `_write` method to write into output file based on the specified language.
    * As a result of this new structure, the process of adding a new language to Odin-II would be much easier.
- A new `getline` method has been added to `libvtrutil`:
    * Yosys use to generates BLIF components in a single line, while Odin-II does vice versa.
    * As a result, Yosys BLIF reading and Odin-II BLIF reading differ from each other in terms of reading BLIF components.
    * To overcome this issue, a new method called `getline` is defined in libvtrutil.
    * Basically, this new method uses the C getdelim function to detects lines.
    * The `getline` method is compatible with Windows and Linux new lines
    * Also, it removes the comment part of an input BLIF line like vtr::fgets.
    * Odin-II uses a method called ""getbline"" to read a complete BLIF line based on the BLIF type.
- Some benchmarks carried syntax errors. To avoid Yosys failure, they have been modified and updated in this PR. #1830 
- For coarse-grain netlist, an option `--fflegalize` is added to make all DFFs rising edge by adding inverters.

**Instruction to use:**
1. Specifying the elaborator in Odin-II command, then Yosys will be run inside Odin-II:
``` 
./odin_II 
             -V circuit_design 
             -a architecturee_file
             -o ODIN_OUTPUT_BLIF
             --elaborator yosys  
             --fflegalize
             ...
```
  The coarse-grain BLIF file and Yosys output log will be created in the same directory where the Odin-II output BLIF file is going to be placed

2. Generate the BLIF file and then pass it to Odin-II
    2.1. Generating Yosys BLIF file using `run_yosys.sh` script, located in ""ODIN_II/regression_test/tools/"".
    * Single test file:
        `./run_yosys -V VERILOG_FILE`
    * A task including multiple test files or a task list(suite)
        `./run_yosys -t TASK.YCFG or TASKLIST`
     task.ycfg is like ordinary VTR task files; however, the user only needs to specify `circuit_dir` and `circuit_list_add`. In the end, this script creates a new directory with the task name at ""/ODIN_II/regression_tests/benchmark/_BLIF/XXX"" and puts all generated BLIF inside it. 
     task.ycfg example:
        ```
         ########################
         # run yosys config
        ########################

        # setup the circuits
         circuits_dir=regression_test/benchmark/verilog/micro

         # circuits' name
         circuit_list_add=*.v
        ```
    **Note**: the support for `include_circuits` option is **not** yet implemented in run_yosys.sh script.
    2.2. Odin-II can be fed by Yosys generated BLIF file using the following command:
    ``` 
    ./odin_II 
             -b YOSYS_GENERATED_BLIF 
             -a architecturee_file
             -o ODIN_OUTPUT_BLIF
             --coarsen  --fflegalize
             ...
    ```
**Note**: the other options, such as passing architecture files, Odin-II XML config files, etc., are the same.

#### Motivation and Context
<!--- Why is this change required? What problem does it solve? -->
Aim to use the Odin-II partial mapping stage, which performs hard logic inference and hard/soft trade-off decisions for such a tool as Yosys. The goal is to automate the decision between what to place in hard blocks or explode into gates. The current Yosys flow forces the user to decide the discrete circuit implementation manually. The approach taken by the synthesizer is to map all discrete components into an available hard block or to explode them when not available, not caring for the device capacity. Our goal is to improve device utilization and simplify the flow by automating this decision with architecture awareness.

Adding files related to Koios benchmarks. Here's a summary of the files:
1. The benchmarks themselves (.v files in the benchmarks/verilog/koios directory)
2. A README file for the benchmarks that provides a link to the documentation, how to cite and who to contact.
3. The arch files that were used with Koios benchmarks in the arch/COFFE_22nm directory
4. Adding a brief description of the benchmarks in the benchmarks.rst file. This goes on the docs pages.
5. Adding a citation of the Koios paper in the bibtex file.

#### Motivation and Context
Adding a set of DL benchmarks for FPGA arch and CAD research

#### Description
<!--- Describe your changes in detail -->
Previously, the simple swap of two items at a time has been used as the sort approach for instance port connection, to reorder them according to the main module (function or task) that they are instantiated from. That would cause an error since we alter the array of ports each time, which results in an unexpected change in the array for future swapping. The new approach uses a helper array to order the ports and then reorder the instantiated instance ports.

Odin_II buffers each signal in block statements like ASSIGN. Moreover, Odin_II eliminates BUF_NODE while doing the partial mapping. Since Odin looks up for clock signals before the partial mapping phase if the actual clock is assigned to a new signal Odin_II considers it as a new separate clock while it is the same as the actual one. This PR resolves the issue by considering the source of each buffered clock signal as the clock signal.

Odin II considered the same memory access in LHS and RHS as different ports with different addresses for hard block memories. In this PR, I resolved this issue by checking the source of new address signals to the connected one if there were any. Moreover, the memory type would have considered 'DUAL_PORT_MEM' even if there was only one port with the same address signals due to the previous design. This issue also has been resolved by considering the 'SINGLE_PORT_MEM' as the default memory type and changing it to the DUAL_PORT_MEM if there is another address signal that is not connected previously.

This commit resolves the missed hierarchical contents for IDENTIFIERs. Odin creates a new IDENTIFIER ast_node when faces global or local variable usage.

#### Description
<!--- Describe your changes in detail -->
This set of changes is designed to allow running full synthesis with custom .xml configuration supplied to ODIN as part of run_vtr_flow procedure. ODIN can now read command line parameters and mix them with configuration file. Also involves a couple of fixes to run_vtr_task and run_vtr_flow.

The discussion was held [here](https://github.com/CAS-Atlantic/vtr-verilog-to-routing/pull/24)

#### Motivation and Context
<!--- Why is this change required? What problem does it solve? -->
The change allows to configure experiments and enable custom ODIN arguments, since currently run_vtr_flow redirects extra command line arguments are redirected to VPR, so there is limited ability to modify ODIN parameters without editing run_vtr_flow.py

- Moving Constant Shift from partial_mapping to netlist_create_from_ast
- Supporting the Variable Shift using Barrel Shift design
- Passing a new variable in the entire netlist_create_from_ast to keep the value of assignment size.
- Adding benchmarks to cover all possible Shift operation criteria, such as operands' signedness, Arithmetic or Logical and Constant or Variable Shift.
#### Related Issue
Issue #38 

#### Motivation and Context
<!--- Why is this change required? What problem does it solve? -->

Odin-II still has not supported the entire Shift feature which is an essential operation in hardware programming and Verilog. By moving Constant Shift to the netlist_create_from_ast, the netlist node creation for the Constant Shift operation has been removed. Also, this approach adds the Variable Shift which has not been supported yet.

#### Description
Using the [old python rewrite branch](https://github.com/verilog-to-routing/vtr-verilog-to-routing/tree/vtr_script_py_rewrite_old) as a starting place, I converted run_reg_test.pl, run_vtr_task.pl, parse_vtr_task.pl and parse_vtr_flow.pl to run_reg_test.py, run_vtr_task.py, parse_vtr_task.py and parse_vtr_flow.py.
These should be direct replacements of the perl counterpart.
Be aware that I placed the parse_vtr_task and parse_vtr_flow within the python library created by the run_vtr_flow pull request.

#### Related Issue
[The issue this partially fixes](https://github.com/SymbiFlow/ideas/issues/16)

#### Motivation and Context
We want to be able to run the vtr test suite without requiring perl to be installed.

#### How Has This Been Tested?
All regression tests pass by using run_reg_test. 
I tested the scripts individually and together, ensuring all parameters are enabled and work.

#### Types of changes

See analytic_placer.h, cut_spreader.h for algorithm summary

An off-the-shelf linear algebra package, Eigen is added to solve matrix equations
A new CMake option, **VPR_ANALYTIC_PLACE** is added.
CMakeLists.txt are modified to check eigen dependecy, if VPR_ANALYTIC_PLACE is set to ON (current default is ON, can change in $VTR_ROOT/CMakeList.txt). If Eigen3 is not found, analytic placement will be disabled, until user manually install eigen3 and rebuild.

A new VPR option **--enable_analytic_placer** is added, false by default
When disabled, the original placement algorithm is run
When enabled, AP takes over after initial_placement, and returns a legal placement to annealer. Annealer is disabled by setting first_t = 0, and goes straight to quench for further optimization

VTR_LOG now captures stats at each iteration of AP.

A new strong test is added to test this option and flow. 

VTR benchmark results for various AP configurations are attached here:
[AP benchmarks (1).xlsx](https://github.com/verilog-to-routing/vtr-verilog-to-routing/files/5185472/AP.benchmarks.1.xlsx)
Notable: for latest revision of AP, place_time for (AP stall=15, quench*25, quench timing recompute * 5) improved by **over 25%** compared to old result. Every AP configuration may need to be rerun to update all the runtime numbers.

Usage example:
(ensure CMake option VPR_ANALYTIC_PLACE is ON when building)
$VTR_ROOT/vpr/vpr  <architecture>.xml    <netlist>.blif   --enable_analytic_placer true

#### Related Issue
#1503#

#### Motivation and Context
To experiment and research Analytic Placer. See related issue for more details.

#### How Has This Been Tested?
vtr_reg_basic, vtr_reg_strong, vtr_reg_titan, with --enable_analytic_placer true
runs are successful but fails golden test as it produces different results, which is expected
with --enable_analytic_placer false it passes all test.

These changes address problem of ODIN's inability to use smaller number of multipliers than it is requested by the circuit. The changes are designed to work with multipliers first, should be easy to extend to adders and other blocks due to the class hierarchy introduced.


#### Motivation and Context
This change is required since sometimes, the synthesis flow for fixed layout would break even if the logic could be attempted to be implemented in soft logic that is not used otherwise. Moreover, setting a limit to number of hard blocks for auto layouts might change  the shape of a device and could prevent from growing the device unnecessary.

The discussion about the design choices was happening in CAS-Atlantic fork of  the repository, available by https://github.com/CAS-Atlantic/vtr-verilog-to-routing/pull/7

#### Description
This adds buffif0, buffif1, notif0 and notif1 to the frontend
as well as the multiplexer ~onto which it maps to in the backend~.
The mapping ~to the multiplexer~ is done during ~partial mapping~*during output blif* as a soft implementation since the tristate buffers can have a hardware equivalent and it would be possible to map these in the future.
We map late so that instantiate a tristate should not require to manually add the unconn manually.

some liberty was taken to also move some decoded mux onto multiplexers to reduce the number of logic elements required.
The memory decoder was also simplified into a single logic element.

1443,10,True,2020-07-23 19:11:42,203,0,3,4,"Add python lint checking, requiring that new Python files pass pylint checking.

#### Description
Added a script, `dev/pylint_check.py` which calls the `pylint` python linter on python files in specified directories.

Currently it is configured to locate all python files in the following directories (recursively), subject to feedback in this pull request.
  * `dev`
  * `ODIN_II`
  * `ace2`
  * `doc`
  * `vpr`
  * `vtr_flow`

The new script includes a list of all existing Python files in these directories that fail linting, and these files will be ""grandfathered"" in, meaning they do not need to pass linting at the moment. However, in the future we would ideally clean up these files so that they pass linting.

A travis CI test is added that ensures this script passes, meaning no (non-grandfathered) python files fail linting.  This will ensure all future Python files added to the repo pass linting.

`pylint` is highly configurable.  Currently, it is running under default configuration (no checks are skipped).  In the future, if we feel some checks are unwarranted, we could modify the configuration.

#### Related Issue
#1434 

#### Motivation and Context
Since we are about to move the core scripts to Python (#1429), it makes sense to set this in place now. 

#### How Has This Been Tested?
New Travis CI test, and lint testing on the new script added in this PR.

Changed the regix in basic.toml of error and warning to be able to pick up messages inputed by the $display function in a verilog file when creating the simulation and synthesis jsons. The syntax for it to be picked up is: $display(""Warning::CAPATALIZED_THING <message>""); 
Usually the capatalized thing is the function the benchmark is testing. This should be used for benchmarks to indicate if a test should pass or fail. Also, if it fails what is going wrong/not functioning properly. A future PR with make a new title called ""Expecatation"" instead of warning.

#### Description
<!--- Describe your changes in detail -->
Created benchmarks for each gate (ie and, xor, etc) that test the width capabilities and different methods of calling said gates. Some .vh tests call a .v test that is standardized and rely
on the width to be defined as well as the operation and possibly if it's binary or unary. There is a wire test (1 bit wide), an index test and then 3 seperate width tests: wide, int_wide, ultra_wide, which are 3 bit wide, 32 bit wide and 256 bit wide respectively. These seperate width tests are called in two different manners. The range catagory calls on a gate with the range inside (ex not([2:0]out,[2:0]in)) while the replicate catagory calls on the gate with an outside array (ex not ar[2:0](out,in)).

Created output_vector_headers_equal which compares the tokens of each vector header and ignores white spaces. This function calls on string_to_token_array which tokenizes each string and returns as an array as well as initializes a pointer passed to the size of the array. Before a strcmp was used.

#### Description
NOTE: The environment that I will clarify in the following is related to using hard adders.

The first dummy adder in the split adder chain is responsible for the general carry-in of the circuit. The inputs of the first dummy adder are connected to the ground and the cin is connected to the carry-in of the entire hard adder. Currently, the cout of the first dummy adder is connected to the cin of the next adder. However, the sumout of the first dummy adder, which contains the value of the general carry-in, should connect to the next cin. This is come from ""ground+ground+cin=sumout+cout.""

this PR adds the non verilog standard `__VA_ARGS__` to simplify some metaprogramming.

the commands run right before converting the AST to assure that conditions are folded.
also fixes arguments not being overrode in defines and some predefined macros

a good example of what this allows:

tmp.v
```Verilog
`define assert(_condition, _fmt, ...) \
    if (! _condition) begin \
        $display(""%s:%s `assert(_condition) failed\n"" _fmt , `__FILE__, `__LINE__, __VA_ARGS__ ); \
        $finish(_condition); \
    end

module test(
    a,
    b
);

input a;
output b;

$display(""line: %d\n"" , `__LINE__ );
`assert(0 != 0, ""forcefully fail -> %s a line %d"", `__FILE__, `__LINE__)

assign b = a;

endmodule
```

the output looks like 
```bash

This PR switches from csv to json to allow more complex content to be stored.  


#### Motivation and Context

#### Description
This PR adds a debugging user interface that enables some features to visualize move generation for placement as follows:
 * Placement pauses at each proposed move
 * The UI highlight the old location of the block in Gold, the new location of the block in GREEN, the fanin and the fanout
 * Print out the move type, move outcome and delta cost in the status bar

The implementation is added under ""VTR_ENABLE_DEBUG_LOGGING"" compilation flag to avoid any overhead in case of release mode.
Moreover, another flag is defined in the code (move_utils.cpp) to enable this debugging feature as the compilation flag is used for many other debugging logging. The flag is called """"f_placer_debug"".

It would be better to group the debugging utilities of each stage (packing-placement-routing) under a flag for this stage. All these flags would be checked only if VTR_ENABLE_DEBUG_LOGGING is on.

this PR adds a lower and ->upper cutoff(future proffing)<- to remove very small results that may be prone to high variance. 

a range [ 0.9, 1.1 ] is proportionnal with the result and (as such) a low cutoff serves the purpose of passing results that would otherwise fail.

As noted in #1114 our current build testing misses this since we default to doing IPO builds, but disable warnings during the link phase (see #634 for why).

#### Motivation and Context
<!--- Why is this change required? What problem does it solve? -->
Warnings often indicate code issues, as a result VTR builds with fairly aggressive warnings turned on. This helps ensure such issues are caught early.
However having the main build produce many errors is problematic as it means developers may miss new warnings which are introduced.
It is therefore important to have automated tests which fail if code is checked-in with warnings to ensure they get fixed.

1067,1,False,,2152,21,6,5,"Squashed commit of project to generate netlist statistics including of
node types, levels, fanout and path length. Parser file to process the
output. Additional arguments added to Odin for Verbose and non-verbose
versions.

#### Description
This is the project aimed at gathering netlist characteristics in Odin like node type, counts, levels, fanout and path length.
The mechanism of collection for basic node information is just a recursive dfs traversal based on output_blif. I ended up separating verbose and non-verbose versions of the stat generator in part because some of the verbose data is irrelevant to basic profiling (# nodes, edges etc.) and because collecting path statistics is costly and possibly not as reliable and/or desirable. The non-verbose version still does a separate dfs of all COs to get the max level. 

Adds to odin.cpp ""--stat"" and --stat_verbose"" arguments.

The parser parse_odin_stats.py processes the output of generate_blif_stats.cpp and dumps it into a csv/tsv. It also can compare outputs and flag major changes etc as part of a set of basic QoR features. The parser could probably be made a bit cleaner in terms of readability but adding/removing metrics is fairly simple.

I left this as a WIP because there were a couple things I wasn't sure about and I wasn't sure to what degree this should be pared down or added to. For example: I left a commented out reversed get_max_levels function in but I don't have any use for it presently, it can be used as a different way of getting path length data but I assume should be removed? I have questions w/r/t the way the max path is calculated. _I will include these questions as well as highlighted code shortly._
In particular the increased overhead of adding data members to the node and net structs should be discussed.

#### Motivation and Context
The intention of the project was to collect data on the netlist struct generated after using -V or -b in Odin-II to quantify possible changes between netlists either as a result of changing the Odin-II logic synthesis process or between Odin and ABC BLIF outputs or other reasons. Basic count information (e.g. #latches) is known or obtained easily from the netlist struct and can be found with the simulator or ABC but other metrics are not as easily obtained, this is a different non-simulator means of collecting basic or verbose stats and at the least provides the framework with which to add other metrics for collection. It is my understanding that there was a netlist_stat struct that was never fully used or implemented. Perhaps it would be easier to start with the non-verbose version, which provides basic desirable information with low overhead.

#### How Has This Been Tested?
Passed running ""make test"" on previous commit, will run again. Unclear what counts as full test coverage. Failed one large memory benchmark because of limitations in testing environment. Works with verilog input and BLIF input although Verilog input will yield very slightly different results. Does not substantially alter existing code aside from odin_types.h and odin_ii.cpp.

#### Description
Creating a list of adders to track them after the first traverse. Also, generate a function look like partial_map to traverse the netlist only for adders, due to the fact that we want to change the adders in each generation. creating a destroy function to track the adder cloud after doing partial_map to free nodes. For each generation, I create a new empty adder and make a copy of input/output pins of previous adder (the adder's pins which were related to the before doing partial_map) in the new one. In this way, I can keep the main pins and change adders without backtracking to the AST.

The elaboration phase is further restructured to be able to properly elaborate the hierarchy. vSYMBOL_ID now accepts the . character for identifiers, and proper verification has been added to ensure that these are used in the correct contexts.

<!--- Provide a general summary of your changes in the Title above -->

#### Description
<!--- Describe your changes in detail -->
This PR refactors the way the `t_type_descriptor` is defined.
It explicitly separates the concepts of `physical` and `logical`.

- Physical Type: this describes the properties of a physical block on the device, such as pin_location, pin_class, width, height, area, etc. It is used mainly during placement and rr_graph generation.
- Logical Type: this describes the internal structure of a logical block. In other words, it will represent the current top level `pb_type` and has pointers on the pb_type and pb_graph_node structures, needed mainly during the packing stage.

#### Related Issue

<!--- If suggesting a new feature or change, please discuss it in an issue first -->
<!--- If fixing a bug, there should be an issue describing it with steps to reproduce -->
<!--- Please link to the issue here: -->
This PR has been previously discussed here https://github.com/verilog-to-routing/vtr-verilog-to-routing/pull/559.

#### Motivation and Context
<!--- Why is this change required? What problem does it solve? -->
Having a neat and explicit separation of physical and logical block is necessary for two main reasons:
- reduces complexity of the code;
- will be critical to have an equivalent site placement feature, for which the same `logical block` can be placed in many different `physical tiles`.

This PR will add basic support for tasks. Odin II will now be able to parse and process verilog files containing basic implementations of tasks. Can support multiple instances of the same task, or have multiple tasks defined and instantiated by the module. Can parse automatic tasks and functions, but these are not yet handled. Updated function_statement in the bison to prevent things that functions cannot do from passing through. Added support for unconnected ports in module instances. 

#### How Has This Been Tested?
Odin pre-commit
Created new verilog files for tests. I have added three equivalent test cases, simple_task.v, which uses a task, simple_function.v, which uses a function, and simple_module.v, which uses a module, all of which implement the same circuit as the existing verilog test file in operators, twobit_arithmetic_plus.v. All four of these verilog files give the same output blif. These files can also be used in the future, if changes are made to how Odin II handles either module instances, function instances, or task instances, we will be able to use these to ensure the output of all four still yields the same result

When building the symbol table, the nodes are no longer copied over, but put directly in the symbol table and then removed completely from the AST, so that these nodes will no longer exist in multiple places. This prevents having to do multiple passes in the code to update the copies, and prevents nodes from being lost when updating both copies to be put in string caches.

This PR should take care of any remaining valgrind leaks from the full benchmarks.

Odin used to throw a warning when a module was given the same name as a defined hard block, which has now been changed to an error message. Some regression tests had to be updated to accommodate the change.

Some of the tests that we changed were our tests for hard block conversions, so new tests are being added to the regression suite to test these instead.

#### Description

There were two issues with the way the targets are defined.

1. The `.%.build` target cannot depend on both `clean` and `_init`. It works
fine with a single-core build, but when executing it in parallel, the
`clean` target breaks the `_init` target. To make it work in parallel the
`_init` target now directly depends on the `clean` target.

2. The `_set_<xxx>` targets have to be executed before the `_build_it`
target - they cannot be executed at the same time. This has been
reworked to use a dynamically defined targets to avoid creating an extra
wrapper target for each of them.

#### Motivation and Context
To be able to build Odin using multiple cores.

#### How Has This Been Tested?
Both mutli and single job builds work for Odin.

Fix leak caused by expand_power and re-enable all verilog test files in valgrind_operators, as they should not be causing any leaks after this PR, PR #872, and PR #865 are all merged. The valgrind_operators will fail without all of these being merged, so the other two should be merged first.

- Expanded support for generate to include nested loop generate constructs with module instantiations and conditional generate constructs (if/else, case). 
- Safeguards against using the same genvar in nested loops are in place, as well as appropriate constant checking. 
- Removed ""GENERATE"" node type as the generate/endgenerate keywords do not change any functionality, and therefore should not change the AST. 
- Added test cases that cover nested loop generates with module instantiations, if/else generates with module instantiations and assignments, case generates with module instantiations and assignments.

Generate blocks were previously only allowed to contain a single for loop without a label; the single for loop was only allowed to contain a single module instance. This has been expanded to allow any legal item (defined in the Verilog standard) within a generate block to be parsed. Nested for loops have been focused on and tested. This expansion also provides a foundation to fully implement generate constructs.

Nets, regs, and parameters must be declared as signed in order to handle signed numbers, which is currently unsupported; otherwise, any value assigned to them must unsigned.

Add simple commands to the makefile of odin to run coverage test and different builds without recompiling the whole project.

#### Related Issue
N/A

#### Motivation and Context
Odin makefile was recompiling Odin entirely every time make was called, now only recompiles when flags are changed and / or there is a file change.

Also this adds flags to run coverage tests and report on odin, also adds more stringent warning flags on demand to Odin only to help debugging.

#### Description
The procedural continuous assignments or PCA(using keywords 'assign' and 'deassign') are procedural statements that allow expressions to be driven continuously onto variables or nets.
The assign procedural continuous assignment statement shall override all procedural assignments to a variable. The 'deassign' procedural statement shall end a procedural continuous assignment to a variable. The value of the variable shall remain the same until the variable is assigned a new value through a procedural assignment or a procedural continuous assignment.

#### Motivation and Context
ODIN_II is an FPGA CAD synthesis compiler which accepts Verilog design as an input. For this reason, it needs to support all keyword in the Verilog language.

#### How Has This Been Tested?
adding some new testbench to ODIN for test the new keywords.
add this operator to the existing test benches.
These tests consist of one and more than one always block, one PCA and if blocks with more than one PCAs.

This change split travis build into multiple stages. They are;

 1) Build VtR
 2) Then test in parallel;
   * Code Formatting
   * C++ Unit Tests
   * Basic Regression Tests
   * Strong Regression Tests
   * Basic Valgrind Memory Tests
   * ODIN-II Micro Tests
   * ODII-II Operator Tests
    
 Travis will run up to 5 jobs at once.
    
This **significantly** reduces the time required for Travis to complete.

The change also;
 * Runs the code formatting in parallel with other tests, gets you feedback faster.
 * Enables support for ccache which significantly reduces the build time for ABC (build time is now under 10m, averaging roughly 5m).
 * Supports a build output outside of the source directory.

Example output on travis now;

Before this PR odin will never implement a multiplier using soft logic if the architecture has a hard multiplier. Which is fixed in 01659c2a68a5951bb7d9a11a1845d968dfaf3195. This PR also fixes the logic of splitting a multiplier into multiple smaller multipliers (2edfbb9a7d9fbf2c60b7c730696ffaf15ef3082f). Finally, it adds a way of implementing soft multipliers using AND gates and a balanced adder tree if the architecture has hard adders instead of implementing soft multipliers using AND gates and soft multipliers only previously (9f591fb287e57189688112bb5de897cca297149c).

This PR introduces two main changes:
- Move all top level pb_type specific tags to tile tags in the architecture XML. This basically makes all pb_types in the `<complexblocklist>` of two types: normal and primitive.
- Implement Equivalent Tiles placement capability. This means that, if the `<tile>` tag in the XML specifies possible equivalent tiles, these can be used during placement.

These changes still need refinement and a review stage to check the direction of this work.

#### Description
<!--- Describe your changes in detail -->
##### Tile tag
The change related to the tile tags is needed to clearly separate the concept of pb_type and top level pb_type. A top level pb_type, in fact, is a physical configurable block of the FPGA that has to be treated differently from the lower level pb_types.
In order to do so, a new tag has been added to the XML, namely the `tiles` tag. It contains all the information relative to the `ex-top level ` pb_types (e.g. fc, pinlocations, switchblock_locations).
This change is addressed in the [`read_xml_arch_file.cpp`](https://github.com/verilog-to-routing/vtr-verilog-to-routing/compare/master...acomodi:equivalent-tiles?expand=1#diff-0a95ec2e9db5bad31bfe7f1f7f450a7a) and [`physical_types.h`](https://github.com/verilog-to-routing/vtr-verilog-to-routing/compare/master...acomodi:equivalent-tiles?expand=1#diff-7294b0eab14f0f67c3b6119931a20cfd).
The current PR is going to fail on CI as the current test architectures do not include the `<tiles>` tag.

##### Equivalent Tile placement
The second change addresses the Equivalent Tiles placement.
What happens is that the placement stage now does not rely strictly on the clusterer decisions: each block belongs to a `top level` pb_type (now called just `tile`), which can be swapped with a corresponding equivalent during placement (if equivalent tiles are present).
There are checks that do ensure that, during the swap stage, blocks are placed only in correct locations (same tiles, or equivalent tiles).

When the placement has finished, the clustering information need to change, as it could happen that a CLB (Clustered Block) that refers to a specific type (e.g. SLICEL), is placed in an equivalent tile (e.g. SLICEM). This situation generates conflicts during the routing stage, as, even being equivalent, the two tiles have different pin configurations.

To address this issue, the clustering context has to be changed with the information about the new pin mappings for the blocks that have been swapped in equivalent tiles. This happens in the background, therefore there was no need to apply changes at routing stage.

The issue that is addressed with this PR is: https://github.com/verilog-to-routing/vtr-verilog-to-routing/issues/513

#### Motivation and Context
<!--- Why is this change required? What problem does it solve? -->
The motivation of moving the top level pb_type definition to another location in the architecture definition is to have a clearer separation on the two concepts of top level pb_type and normal/primitive pb_type. 

Instead, the Equivalent Tiles feature is an improvement in VPR. With the ability to use equivalent locations, placer can choose for a better solution when trying to find the best placement, reducing its final cost.
Moreover, this solution can overcome the fact that the packer is not aware of the possibility to use an equivalent tile (and it should correctly not be aware of that) and the job is left to the placer. In fact, the packer may always choose to implement a cluster using a certain tile instead of another, even though there are other tiles that could be used. 
In this case, there could be designs which would consume more resources (tiles) than the available ones and the placer, if allowed, could place the exceeding blocks in the equivalent locations.

General Roadmap to incremental modification 
1.Complete the RRGraph object interface (https://github.com/verilog-to-routing/vtr-verilog-to-routing/blob/rr_graph_obj/vpr/src/route/rr_graph.h). The prototype linked does not fully encapsulate the t_switch_inf into RRGraph. The RRGraph will focus only on the graph nature, which means it will only contain a list of nodes, a list of edges which connects nodes, R&C info of each node,  direction and coordination of nodes, etc. The RRGraph will include a few fast look-ups to allow users to fetch nodes or related info quickly. In addition, we should add the configurable and non-configurable edge info, which is required by router.
2. Build the new RRGraph object from the existing RR graph data structures (as in https://github.com/verilog-to-routing/vtr-verilog-to-routing/blob/rr_graph_obj/vpr/src/route/build_rr_graph.cpp#L306-L383). This avoids having to make changes to the existing RR graph construction code initially. This will change the buid_rr_graph function using the new interfaces (mutators) of RRGraph
3. Update all downstream code (e.g. router, RR graph writer) to use the new RRGraph object interface instead of the old legacy data structures. In particular, we will develop a rr_graph writer first to see if the new builder is correct or not.
4. Update the RR graph reader to construct the new RRGraph object directly (instead of indirectly through the old data structures). Once this is done you should be able to load an existing rr_graph.xml file and run the router without having to build an RR graph using the old data structures.
5. Update the RR graph construction code to directly build the new RRGraph object
6. Delete the old RR graph data structures (t_rr_node, t_rr_edge, and relevant members of the device_ctx)

#### Description
<!--- Describe your changes in detail -->
Currently, step 1-3 have been done 
#### Related Issue
<!--- Pull requests should be related to open issues -->

#### Description
Verilog language coverage
An indexed Part-select extract a specific range of array which can be a positive integer value. Part-select just accepts the range in the boundary. It consists of two operators: pluscolon and minuscolon.
This is the second type of implementing part-select by using the existing range-ref type.

#### Motivation and Context
ODIN_II is an FPGA CAD synthesis compiler which accepts Verilog design as an input. For this reason, it needs to support all keyword in the Verilog language which part-select index is one of the operators in this language.

#### How Has This Been Tested?
adding some new testbench to ODIN for test the new keywords.
add this operator to the existing test benches.

SRC: netlist_create_from_ast.cpp

Signed-off-by: Hillary Soontiens <hsoontie@unb.ca>

#### Description
A function call to create a node's full name was fixed so that it would properly insert the end of the name in the case of a data width (port size) of 1.

#### Related Issue
The bug would cause a segmentation fault when specifying a data width of 1 in memory_controller.v and running it on odin_II.cpp. The issue seemed to arise because when using single-port-ram, certain input drivers could not be detected mid-synthesis.

#### Motivation and Context
Having a data width of 1 is a valid special case.

#### How Has This Been Tested?
memory_controller.v was tested primarily, using data/address widths of 1/1, 2/1, 2/2 as well as other larger values.

Added more regression test coverage to Odin II and fixed `spree` benchmark. 

#### Description
<!--- Describe your changes in detail -->
A regression test to highlight a missing feature of Odin II was added and another to highlight a feature of the supported for loops. 
Modified the `spree` benchmark in the Odin II _bug folder to compile successfully.
`spree` now uses smaller memory blocks.
The old spree benchmark would not successfully compile software memories because the address space was too large, so the address spaces were shrunk to 16-bit for the `imem` and `dmem` blocks and 5-bit for the `regfile` blocks.
Also cleaned up the `spree` benchmark to use consistent formatting, and removed commented out code.
These are new benchmarks and not code changes to any part of the VTR flow so other than these tests no test suites were run.

<!--- Why is this change required? What problem does it solve? -->
Allows `spree.v` to move to the next stage of the vtr_flow when using architectures with hard-block memory.
Added additional regression test coverage and a test to highlight a missing feature.

The Verilog file for `for` loop regression testing was run through the Odin II simulator with input and output files.
The regression test for the missing feature was run and fails as expected.
The new `spree.v` benchmark was run through Odin II and the vtr_flow with the `k6_N10_mem32K_40nm.xml` architecture successfully.

Verilog language coverage
An indexed Part-select extract a specific range of array which can be a positive integer value. Part-select just accepts the range in the bounray. It consists of two operators: pluscolon and minuscolon.

#### Description
this PR adds the ODIN simulator fix to be able to test the flow with multi clock circuits.
it has different configurations to test the flow with .flops, .whitebox and .blackbox either via an itterative approach by clock domain 

(a clok domain is specified by its initial value, edge sensitivity and clock driver for flip flops)

so far neither .flops or white box work as ABC sti strips them out, so only the black boxing approach prevents ABC from mangling them


#### Related Issue
this is related to the issue #384 with post ABC clock restoration

#### How Has This Been Tested?
each single run are tested through the modified odin simulator to support multiple clocks
This is not ready to be merged as the new simulator does not support the old input vector (the simulator clocks are driven by input file or when generating new cricuit vectors, via command line parameter).
the regression test for ODIN need to be redone and this is not finished yet as we are rewritting the regression suite to be stronger and have a basic suite, hand written for reliabilility.

To run the test through the modified flow and verify different model I have provided a regression suite 
accessible via `./run_reg_test.pl vtr_reg_multiclock`

This PR allows the flow to do the following in any combination:

- run odin simulation on the pre ABC blif vs post ABC
- use the latch information restoration script with and without the typo fix.
- can run one of the 4 ABC flow type:
-- iterative black boxing of latches with different clock domain, 
-- a blanket approach where all latches are black boxed
-- use vanilla latches
-- dont use abc at all

a clock domain is uniquely identified by the triplet of edge type, control, and initial value (which is pushed onto ABC during optimization)
This PR uses odin to generate test in/out vectors and then compare these against the post synthesis blif file. 
We include the initial value in the clock domain so that simulation on the pre vs post optimization blif file can be used to verify correctness of the circuit in simulation.

The motivation in this change is to make it easier to run under NixOS,
which does not support absolute paths.  Note that a part of the scripts is
already using the `#!/usr/bin/env ...` shebang, which correctly calls the
executable which is present in the user's environment.  This commit makes this
behavior consistent over all scripts.

Also, the executable flags were missing for part of the scripts.

As implemented here VTR now uses an un-patched version of ABC.
In the future, upgrading ABC will only require running:
```
./dev/update_external_trees.py abc
```
from the VTR root, which will automatically update the ABC sub-tree to the latest version.
